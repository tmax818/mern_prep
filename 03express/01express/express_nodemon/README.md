# express

>Express.js is a framework written in JavaScript which acts as an interface to Node's server functionality. It is also the E in the MERN stack, so it must be important! Express allows us to create a robust server with more or less whatever architecture we choose. There are many other server frameworks for Node including Hapi, Koa, and Fastify; however Express is extremely popular, as evidenced by its weekly download stats on [npmjs.com].

# nodemon

>When we run the server using `node server.js` we will have to restart the server manually every time we update our code; otherwise, the running app will not reflect the changes. This is where Nodemon comes into play.
